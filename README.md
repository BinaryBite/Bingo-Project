This is a simple project done for my university that is intended to create and modify a series of bingo cards.

Most code is written by me with some help from other students on bingoanalysis.py (who will remain anonymous).

All code is reviewed by me.

Run bingo_start.py to start the program.

requires tkinter, numpy, matplotlib, pandas, scipy, fpdf
